Abstract
Candida auris (C. auris) is a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen that has emerged as a significant threat to global health. Shifts in climatic conditions may be driving its adaptation and pathogenicity. Its elevated thermotolerance has been hypothesized as the first pathogen adaptation led by anthropogenic climate change. In this study, we analyzed 801 whole-genome sequences isolated in clinical settings from the New York-New Jersey region from 2016 to 2024. We identified previously described antifungal resistance genes, their associated point mutations, heat tolerance genes, and their link with key climatic variables using mixed-effects logistic regression models. Our analysis revealed that the heat tolerance genes HSP90 and HSP104 were present in over 98% of isolates, whereas HSP70 and HOG1 were not detected. Among the antifungal resistance-related genes, several of them showed significant associations with climatic variables (p<0.05). Precipitation was consistently linked to increased prevalence in antifungal resistance genes and their associated point mutations, suggesting that elevated moisture levels may promote favorable conditions for fungal growth and biofilm formation. Additionally, the interaction between climatic variables showed a stronger association with the presence of resistance genes, evidencing the multifactorial nature of climate change in shaping pathogen adaptations. These findings emphasize the influence of climatic variables on the resistome of C. auris, which is crucial for predicting the spread and resistance patterns of C. auris as climate change continues.
